# CryoJAM: Automating Protein Homolog Fitting in Medium Resolution Cryo-EM Density Maps Using Deep Learning

CryoJAM automates the fitting of protein homologs into cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps, focusing on large multi-subunit protein complexes at medium resolutions (4-8 Ã…). Utilizing advanced 3D Convolutional Neural Network architectures, CryoJAM enhances the fitting process, addressing the computational and time challenges present in traditional methods.
